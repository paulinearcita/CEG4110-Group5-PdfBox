# CEG4110-Group5-PdfBox
This is the PDF Box implementation by Group 5 for CEG 4110 Spring 2021. We are using PDF Box to implement various pdf editing capabilities, such as saving pdf as image, saving pdf as powerpoint, extracting images from pdf files, editing text in pdf file and so much more!

All files that we have worked on are included in this repository. Starting from User Stories, Backlogs, implementation of tasks, test results as well as Software Design Document.

"Group5 - UserStories" file includes all the user stories for our team.

"Group5 - Backlog" file is the backlog for our project where we keep track of our Sprint information, tasks and velocity points.

The source codes are located at "PDFEditor > src" and you will find all the source codes that our team has been working on to implement pdf editing capabilities using PdfBox. Each java file is made to implement its own feature using PdfBox. 

Our team implemented codes and tested these features to make sure that everything works. All of our testing results are stored in the "TestResults" folder. There are subfolders titled with the user story number so that traceability is easy.

User stories and tasks are given numbers (detailed in the backlog), and each branch and pull request was labelled accordingly, i.e., "username-t0##". Branches not related to a task or user story were given descriptive titles.

Our source code files are formatted using doxygen comments, and the SDD via automatic generation using doxygen is in the SDD folder.

Other files include, "Team.md" which contains a list of our team members with their corresponding usernames, and "featuresList.md" which has a list of features implemented in our project.
